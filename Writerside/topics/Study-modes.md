# Study modes

The app supports two distinct study modes.

## Review mode (SRS-based)

- Shows only cards that are due based on the SRS schedule
- After revealing the answer, you rate the card (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
- The rating updates the SRS schedule to decide when you’ll see the card next

### Review mode tag filtering

During review you can filter the queue by one or more tags:

- Match **Any** selected tag (OR)
- Match **All** selected tags (AND)

A tag cloud is also shown to visualize tag frequency and quickly toggle filters.

## Cram mode (all cards)

- Presents all cards in a deck regardless of SRS status
- Does **not** update SRS scheduling
- Useful for quick refreshers or pre-exam cramming

### Cram mode tag filtering

Cram sessions can also be filtered by tags (Any/All match), scoped to tags in the selected deck.

## Deck list SRS columns

The deck list includes SRS counts per deck:

- Due (includes new cards)
- New
- Reviewed
- Total
