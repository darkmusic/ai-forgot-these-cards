# Study modes

The app supports two distinct study modes.

## Review mode (SRS-based)

- Shows only cards that are due based on the SRS schedule
- After revealing the answer, you rate the card (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
- The rating updates the SRS schedule to decide when you’ll see the card next

### Review mode tag filtering

During review you can filter the queue by one or more tags:

- Match **Any** selected tag (OR)
- Match **All** selected tags (AND)

A tag cloud is also shown to visualize tag frequency and quickly toggle filters.

## Cram mode (all cards)

- Presents all cards in a deck regardless of SRS status
- Does **not** update SRS scheduling
- Useful for quick refreshers or pre-exam cramming

### Cram mode tag filtering

Cram sessions can also be filtered by tags (Any/All match), scoped to tags in the selected deck.

## Deck list SRS columns

The deck list includes SRS counts per deck:

- Due (includes new cards)
- New
- Reviewed
- Total

## Making efficient use of tags

Tags are a powerful way to organize and filter your cards during study sessions, so make use of them! Here are some tips for using tags effectively:

- Use descriptive tags that reflect the content or context of the card (e.g., "grammar", "vocabulary", "history").
- Combine multiple tags to create focused study sessions (e.g., "biology" AND "photosynthesis").
- Regularly review and update your tags to ensure they remain relevant and useful for your study goals.
- Create meta tags for broader categories (e.g., "exam-prep", "difficult", "daily-review") to quickly filter cards in a specific deck based on your study plans, instead of resorting to creating another deck just for a subset of cards.
